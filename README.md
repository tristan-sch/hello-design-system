# Design - UI Design System

This is my assignment for Module 3 **Design - UI Design System**.

- [Go to the guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f1339b5b279dc27c467cb22)

- [Go to my Figma project](https://www.figma.com/file/UZvRBsLBbBPICrp4t56L7q/AD-Travel---Design-system)

## What did I do?

- Since I have to design a website for the travel agency I work for, **AD Travel**, I decided to link this assignment to it.

- I followed this [general tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7F4muGAMfA) and this [grid tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_w-iYiEXrl0)

## Typography

I chose the pairing [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito) and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans).

I was looking for light and engaging fonts. Something nice to look at, without complexity.

## Colors

- I took the blue from the AD Travel logo as a basis and made two other declinations playing with the contrast, dark and light.
- I wanted to have a green for the sustainability aspect.
- The yellow is for the Icelandic summer, midnight sun and to bring warm colors.

## Buttons

- I created 5 types of buttons for different uses
- I went for a simple design, only playing with colors

## Coming soon

I am aware that my design system is missing elements, I will complete it when I have more time, I do not want to rush it.
